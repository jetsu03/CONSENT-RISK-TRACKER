## Overview
Modern web users often unknowingly grant sensitive permissions and cookie consent to websites while browsing online. This poses significant data privacy risks, especially for users in **Financial, Health, Nuclear Energy, and Consulting sectors** who may inadvertently provide access to sensitive data.
This solution provides complete visibility and control over browser permissions and cookies through automated extraction, risk analysis, and interactive dashboards.

## Why This Matters
- **Hidden Permissions**: Users grant camera, location, microphone access without tracking
- **Cookie Proliferation**: Hundreds of tracking cookies accumulate over time
- **Third-Party Risks**: External domains gain access to sensitive user data
- **Compliance Requirements**: Organizations need audit trails for privacy regulations
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Stale permissions create attack vectors for hackers

## Features
### Data Extraction
- Extracts browser cookies from local Chrome profile
- Retrieves permission metadata (camera, location, notifications, etc.)
- Captures website trust scores and access patterns
- Identifies third-party vs first-party cookies

### Risk Assessment
- **Rule-based risk scoring** categorizing cookies as High/Medium/Low
- Frequency-based analysis (frequent sites = higher risk)
- Age-based scoring (older cookies = potential security risks)
- Third-party tracking identification

### Visualization & Reporting
- Interactive Power BI dashboard with multiple views
- Risk trend analysis and domain-specific insights
- Permission usage patterns by browser type
- Privacy score calculations and alerts

### Data Management
- Structured Excel workbook for easy management
- Automated data refresh and historical tracking
- Export capabilities for compliance reporting

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Google Chrome** (with local profile access)
- **Microsoft Excel** 2016 or later
- **Power BI Desktop** (free version available)
- **Windows/macOS/Linux** support
